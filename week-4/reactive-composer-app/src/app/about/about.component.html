  <p>
    Beethoven comes from a lineage of musicians. His grandfather was well
    regarded where they were from, and he had great pride in his family. However,
    his father had become an alcoholic after the death of his grandfather.
    Beethovenâ€™s father wished him to be a child prodigy, like Mozart and would
    often lie about his age. Even convincing a young Beethoven about the actual
    year he was born. Sadly, his father was also known to abuse Beethoven to
    make him a better player. In his late 20s he started to experience hearing
    loss as well. Despite all this, he still ended up becoming a world renown
    composer for many generations to come.
